			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h2>
			<p>Colville had readied this point in that sarcastic study of his own condition of mind for the advantage of his late readers in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Post-Democrat-Republican</i>, when he was aware of a polite rustling of draperies, with an ensuing well-bred murmur, which at once ignored him, deprecated intrusion upon him, and asserted a common right to the prospect on which he had been dwelling alone. He looked round with an instinctive expectation of style and poise, in which he was not disappointed. The lady, with a graceful lift of the head and a very erect carriage, almost Bernhardtesque in the backward fling of her shoulders and the strict compression of her elbows to her side, was pointing out the different bridges to the little girl who was with her.</p>
			<p>“That first one is the Santa Trinità, and the next is the Carraja, and that one quite down by the Cascine is the iron bridge. The Cascine you remember⁠—the park where we were driving⁠—that clump of woods there⁠—”</p>
			<p>A vagueness expressive of divided interest had crept into the lady’s tone rather than her words. Colville could feel that she was waiting for the right moment to turn her delicate head, sculpturesquely defined by its toque, and steal an imperceptible glance at him: and he involuntarily afforded her the coveted excuse by the slight noise he made in changing his position in order to be able to go away as soon as he had seen whether she was pretty or not. At forty-one the question is still important to every man with regard to every woman.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Colville!”</p>
			<p>The gentle surprise conveyed in the exclamation, without time for recognition, convinced Colville, upon a cool review of the facts, that the lady had known him before their eyes met.</p>
			<p>“Why, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen!” he said.</p>
			<p>She put out her round, slender arm, and gave him a frank clasp of her gloved hand. The glove wrinkled richly up the sleeve of her dress halfway to her elbow. She bent on his face a demand for just what quality and degree of change he found in hers, and apparently she satisfied herself that his inspection was not to her disadvantage, for she smiled brightly, and devoted the rest of her glance to an electric summary of the facts of Colville’s physiognomy; the sufficiently good outline of his visage, with its full, rather close-cut, drabbish-brown beard and moustache, both shaped a little by the ironical self-conscious smile that lurked under them; the noncommittal, rather weary-looking eyes; the brown hair, slightly frosted, that showed while he stood with his hat still off. He was a little above the middle height, and if it must be confessed, neither his face nor his figure had quite preserved their youthful lines. They were both much heavier than when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen saw them last, and the latter here and there swayed beyond the strict bounds of symmetry. She was herself in that moment of life when, to the middle-aged observer, at least, a woman’s looks have a charm which is wanting to her earlier bloom. By that time her character has wrought itself more clearly out in her face, and her heart and mind confront you more directly there. It is the youth of her spirit which has come to the surface.</p>
			<p>“I should have known you anywhere,” she exclaimed, with friendly pleasure in seeing him.</p>
			<p>“You are very kind,” said Colville. “I didn’t know that I had preserved my youthful beauty to that degree. But I can imagine it⁠—if you say so, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I assure you that you have!” she protested; and now she began gently to pursue him with one fine question after another about himself, till she had mastered the main facts of his history since they had last met. He would not have known so well how to possess himself of hers, even if he had felt the same necessity; but in fact it had happened that he had heard of her from time to time at not very long intervals. She had married a leading lawyer of her Western city, who in due time had gone to Congress, and after his term was out had “taken up his residence” in Washington, as the newspapers said, “in his elegant mansion at the corner of &amp; Street and Idaho Avenue.” After that he remembered reading that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen was going abroad for the education of her daughter, from which he made his own inferences concerning her marriage. And “You knew <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bowen was no longer living?” she said, with fit obsequy of tone.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I knew,” he answered, with decent sympathy.</p>
			<p>“This is my little Effie,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen after a moment; and now the child, hitherto keeping herself discreetly in the background, came forward and promptly gave her hand to Colville, who perceived that she was not so small as he had thought her at first; an effect of infancy had possibly been studied in the brevity of her skirts and the immaturity of her corsage, but both were in good taste, and really to the advantage of her young figure. There was reason and justice in her being dressed as she was, for she really was not so old as she looked by two or three years; and there was reason in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen’s carrying in the hollow of her left arm the India shawl sacque she had taken off and hung there; the deep cherry silk lining gave life to the sombre tints prevailing in her dress, which its removal left free to express all the grace of her extremely ladylike person. Ladylike was the word for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen throughout⁠—for the turn of her head, the management of her arm from the elbow, the curve of her hand from wrist to fingertips, the smile, subdued, but sufficiently sweet, playing about her little mouth, which was yet not too little, and the refined and indefinite perfume which exhaled from the ensemble of her silks, her laces, and her gloves, like an odorous version of that otherwise impalpable quality which women call style. She had, with all her flexibility, a certain charming stiffness, like the stiffness of a very tall feather.</p>
			<p>“And have you been here a great while?” she asked, turning her head slowly toward Colville, and looking at him with a little difficulty she had in raising her eyelids; when she was younger the glance that shyly stole from under the covert of their lashes was like a gleam of sunshine, and it was still like a gleam of paler sunshine.</p>
			<p>Colville, whose mood was very susceptible to the weather, brightened in the ray. “I only arrived last night,” he said, with a smile.</p>
			<p>“How glad you must be to get back! Did you ever see Florence more beautiful than it was this morning?”</p>
			<p>“Not for years,” said Colville, with another smile for her pretty enthusiasm. “Not for seventeen years at the least calculation.”</p>
			<p>“Is it so many?” cried <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen, with lovely dismay. “Yes, it is,” she sighed, and she did not speak for an appreciable interval.</p>
			<p>He knew that she was thinking of that old love affair of his, to which she was privy in some degree, though he never could tell how much; and when she spoke he perceived that she purposely avoided speaking of a certain person, whom a woman of more tact or of less would have insisted upon naming at once. “I never can believe in the lapse of time when I get back to Italy; it always makes me feel as young as when I left it last.”</p>
			<p>“I could imagine you’d never left it,” said Colville.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen reflected a moment. “Is that a compliment?”</p>
			<p>“I had an obscure intention of saying something fine; but I don’t think I’ve quite made it out,” he owned.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen gave her small, sweet smile. “It was very nice of you to try. But I haven’t really been away for some time; I’ve taken a house in Florence, and I’ve been here two years. Palazzo Pinti, Lung’ Arno della Zecca. You must come and see me. Thursdays from four till six.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” said Colville.</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen, remotely preparing to offer her hand in adieu, “that Effie and I broke in upon some very important cogitations of yours.” She shifted the silken burden off her arm a little, and the child stirred from the correct pose she had been keeping, and smiled politely.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think they deserve a real dictionary word like that,” said Colville. “I was simply mooning. If there was anything definite in my mind, I was wishing that I was looking down on the Wabash in Dos Vaches, instead of the Arno in Florence.”</p>
			<p>“Oh! And I supposed you must be indulging all sorts of historical associations with the place. Effie and I have been walking through the Via de’ Bardi, where Romola lived, and I was bringing her back over the Ponte Vecchio, so as to impress the origin of Florence on her mind.”</p>
			<p>“Is that what makes Miss Effie hate it?” asked Colville, looking at the child, whose youthful resemblance to her mother was in all things so perfect that a fantastic question whether she could ever have had any other parent swept through him. Certainly, if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen were to marry again, there was nothing in this child’s looks to suggest the idea of a predecessor to the second husband.</p>
			<p>“Effie doesn’t hate any sort of useful knowledge,” said her mother half jestingly. “She’s just come to me from school at Vevay.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, then, I think she might,” persisted Colville. “Don’t you hate the origin of Florence a little?” he asked of the child.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know enough about it,” she answered, with a quick look of question at her mother, and checking herself in a possibly indiscreet smile.</p>
			<p>“Ah, that accounts for it,” said Colville, and he laughed. It amused him to see the child referring even this point of propriety to her mother, and his thoughts idled off to what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen’s own untrammelled girlhood must have been in her Western city. For her daughter there were to be no buggy rides, or concerts, or dances at the invitation of young men; no picnics, free and unchaperoned as the casing air; no sitting on the steps at dusk with callers who never dreamed of asking for her mother; no lingering at the gate with her youthful escort home from the ball⁠—nothing of that wild, sweet liberty which once made American girlhood a long rapture. But would she be any the better for her privations, for referring not only every point of conduct, but every thought and feeling, to her mother? He suppressed a sigh for the inevitable change, but rejoiced that his own youth had fallen in the earlier time, and said, “You will hate it as soon as you’ve read a little of it.”</p>
			<p>“The difficulty <em>is</em> to read a little of Florentine history. I can’t find anything in less than ten or twelve volumes,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen. “Effie and I were going to Viesseux’s Library again, in desperation, to see if there wasn’t something shorter in French.”</p>
			<p>She now offered Colville her hand, and he found himself very reluctant to let it go. Something in her looks did not forbid him, and when she took her hand away, he said, “Let me go to Viesseux’s with you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen, and give you the advantage of my unprejudiced ignorance in the choice of a book on Florence.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I was longing to ask you!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen frankly. “It is really such a serious matter, especially when the book is for a young person. Unless it’s very dry, it’s so apt to be⁠—objectionable.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said Colville, with a smile at her perplexity. He moved off down the slope of the bridge with her, between the jewellers’ shops, and felt a singular satisfaction in her company. Women of fashion always interested him; he liked them; it diverted him that they should take themselves seriously. Their resolution, their suffering for their ideal, such as it was, their energy in dressing and adorning themselves, the pains they were at to achieve the trivialities they passed their lives in, were perpetually delightful to him. He often found them people of great simplicity, and sometimes of singularly good sense; their frequent vein of piety was delicious.</p>
			<p>Ten minutes earlier he would have said that nothing could have been less welcome to him than this encounter, but now he felt unwilling to leave <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen.</p>
			<p>“Go before, Effie,” she said; and she added, to Colville, “How very Florentine all this is! If you dropped from the clouds on this spot without previous warning, you would know that you were on the Ponte Vecchio, and nowhere else.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it’s very Florentine,” Colville assented. “The bridge is very well as a bridge, but as a street I prefer the Main Street Bridge at Des Vaches. I was looking at the jewellery before you came up, and I don’t think it’s pretty, even the old pieces of peasant jewellery. Why do people come here to look at it? If you were going to buy something for a friend, would you dream of coming here for it?”</p>
			<p>“Oh <em>no</em>!” replied <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen, with the deepest feeling.</p>
			<p>They quitted the bridge, and turning to the left, moved down the street which with difficulty finds space between the parapet of the river and the shops of the mosaicists and dealers in statuary cramping it on the other hand.</p>
			<p>“Here’s something distinctively Florentine too,” said Colville. “These tabletops, and paperweights, and caskets, and photograph frames, and lockets, and breastpins; and here, this ghostly glare of undersized Psyches and Hebes and Graces in alabaster.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think of any of them!” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen broke in with horror. “If your friend wishes you to get her something characteristically Florentine, and at the same time very tasteful, you must go⁠—”</p>
			<p>Colville gave a melancholy laugh. “My friend is an abstraction, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen, without sex or any sort of entity.”</p>
			<p>“Oh!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen. Some fine drops had begun to sprinkle the pavement. “What a ridiculous blunder! It’s raining! Effie, I’m afraid we must give up your book for today. We’re not dressed for damp weather, and we’d better hurry home as soon as possible.” She got promptly into the shelter of a doorway, and gathered her daughter to her, while she flung her sacque over her shoulder and caught her draperies from the ground for the next movement. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Colville, will you please stop the first closed carriage that comes in sight?”</p>
			<p>A figure of <i xml:lang="it">primo tenore</i> had witnessed the manoeuvre from the box of his cab; he held up his whip, and at a nod from Colville he drove abreast of the doorway, his broken-kneed, tremulous little horse gay in brass-mounted harness, and with a stiff turkey feather stuck upright at one ear in his headstall.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bowen had no more scruple than another woman in stopping travel and traffic in a public street for her convenience. She now entered into a brisk parting conversation with Colville, such as ladies love, blocking the narrow sidewalk with herself, her daughter, and her open carriage door, and making people walk round her cab, in the road, which they did meekly enough, with the Florentine submissiveness to the pretensions of any sort of vehicle. She said a dozen important things that seemed to have just come into her head, and, “Why, how stupid I am!” she called out, making Colville check the driver in his first start, after she had got into the cab. “We are to have a few people tonight. If you have no engagement, I should be so glad to have you come. Can’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I can,” said Colville, admiring the whole transaction and the parties to it with a passive smile.</p>
			<p>After finding her pocket, she found that her card-case was not in it, but in the purse she had given Effie to carry; but she got her address at last, and gave it to Colville, though he said he should remember it without. “Any time between nine and eleven,” she said. “It’s so nice of you to promise!”</p>
			<p>She questioned him from under her half-lifted eyelids, and he added, with a laugh, “I’ll come!” and was rewarded with two pretty smiles, just alike, from mother and daughter, as they drove away.</p>
